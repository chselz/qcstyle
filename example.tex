    In this document, it is demonstrated how to use abbreviations and colors from \texttt{qcsytyle}.

\subsection{Abbreviations}
    Here are a few examples:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Calculations were performed with \orca\
      \item The best program is \xtb\ for sqm and it has \emph{no} bugs.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Colored Elements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Here something is written in \textcolor{bonnblue}{blue}, optionally also via \verb|\colb{}|.
        \item For comparison something in \textcolor{blue}{normal blue}.
    \end{itemize}
